## What is this project?
This is my old abandoned project, this was ment to be mobile 2D game where you can travel across space. Basically starbound clone. Of course after short time I realized that this is way toooo big for single person project. But basics of engine are there. In fact this is probably the biggest game engine I wrote.

## So what's there?
Well game engine which uses LibGDX for crossplatform support and KryoNet for networking stuff. This engine have several features:
- Multiplayer support 
- Optimized to run on mobile devices (back when I was working on it it was running smoothly on old 4 core mid segment smartphone)
- Lighting engine (light masks technique)
-
